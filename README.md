## Project Overview
PROG6112-ICE2 is a Java project consisting of two classes, PROG6112ICE2.java and LibraryInventory.java, created for ICE Task 2. The first class, PROG6112ICE2, is a simple entry-point program that prints “Hello World!” and demonstrates the basic NetBeans project setup.

## Library Inventory Description
The second class, LibraryInventory, is a console-based program simulating a Library and Multimedia Centre inventory system. It demonstrates the use of 2D and 3D arrays, initialization, sorting, flattening, and displaying of data. The program works with integer arrays to represent book counts per section and string arrays to represent book titles across branches and sections.

## Features
The features include creating and initializing arrays, sorting rows in ascending order, flattening arrays into a single sorted list, generating book titles automatically in the format B{branch}-S{section}-Book{number}, and displaying arrays with proper formatting. Each operation is implemented in its own method, with arrays passed as parameters to encourage good programming practice.

## File Structure
The file structure includes:
* com.mycompany.prog6112.ice2 containing PROG6112ICE2.java
* ice2 containing LibraryInventory.java

## How to Run
1. Open NetBeans IDE.
2. Create a project named PROG6112-ICE2.
3. Add the files to their respective packages.
4. Build the project.
5. Run LibraryInventory.java to see the inventory simulation.

## Expected Output
Running the program will show unsorted and sorted arrays, both for numeric book counts and string-based book titles, with clear before-and-after results.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helps students learn Java packages, multidimensional arrays, the use of Arrays.sort, and good coding practices such as modular design and clear documentation.
